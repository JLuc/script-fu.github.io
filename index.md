### Quickstart in Script-Fu

First create a local directory as a sandbox for new scripts. Add that directory in Gimp as a Scripts folder.
*Gimp->Edit->Preferences->Folders->Scripts (add new folder).*

Restart Gimp, any scripts in that new folder should appear as menu items
or useable procedures. 

After editing and saving a script I press the "#" key in Gimp, 
which can be set as a keyboard shortcut to refresh scripts.
*Gimp->Edit->Keyboard Shortcuts (Refresh Scripts)*

I keep the Error Console window open at all times.
It's the only way I've been able to find to debug a script.\
*Gimp->Windows->Dockable Dialogues->Error Console*
