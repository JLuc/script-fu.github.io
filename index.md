### For novices and artists interested in Script-Fu here is a quickstart guide.

First create a local directory as a sandbox for new scripts.  

Add that directory in Gimp as a Scripts folder.
Gimp->Edit->Preferences->Folders->Scripts (add new folder).
Restart Gimp, any scripts in that new folder should appear as menu items
or useable procedures. 

I edit my scripts using "Atom" a free editor. After editing and saving a script I press the "#" key in Gimp, 
which has been set as a keyboard shortcut to refresh scripts.
Gimp->Edit->Keyboard Shortcuts (Refresh Scripts)

Also, keep the Error Console window open at all times.
It's the only way I've been able to find to debug a script.
Gimp->Windows->Dockable Dialogues->Error Console
