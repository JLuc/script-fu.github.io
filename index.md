### Quickstart in Script-Fu

* Create a local directory as a sandbox for new scripts. Add that directory in Gimp as a Scripts folder.
  \
  Restart Gimp, any scripts in that new folder should appear as menu items or useable procedures.\
*Gimp->Edit->Preferences->Folders->Scripts (add new folder)*

* After editing and saving a script, I press the "#" key in Gimp,
set up as a keyboard shortcut.
\
*Gimp->Edit->Keyboard Shortcuts (Refresh Scripts)*

* Keep the Error Console window open. It's the only way I've been able to find to debug a script.\
*Gimp->Windows->Dockable Dialogues->Error Console*
